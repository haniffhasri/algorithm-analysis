The Mystery of Marshall Mansion Murder
Last Christmas, I was invited to the Marshall Mansion by Lashram Rivers, a friend I
had met a few months before at another friend’s wedding party, for a private dinner
since I just moved into the city and had no one to celebrate Thanksgiving with.
Rivers was adopted by Mr Phillip Marshall, the mansion's owner, when he was 8
years old. Mr Marshall is a wealthy businessman who runs several manufacturing
factories all over the US, and Rivers helps manages the business for Marshall.
Close families and friends attended the dinner. Mr Marshall’s children, Jones and
Jenna Marshall, his brother and sister, Peter and Penelope Marshall, his uncle Will
Marshall and several other close friends of the family; around 15 people were eating
at the large dining table that night.
The dinner was wonderful, with plenty of food to eat. But suddenly, in the middle of
the desert, Mr Marshall gasped and fell off his chair. Everyone was panicking, and I
ran to Mr Marshall to see what could be done. A few minutes later, while waiting for
the ambulance, Mr Marshall was not breathing anymore.
Part 1: Who poisoned Marshall?
A few moments before Mr Marshall passed away, he whispered, “I know who did
this”. As a detective who works for the Police department in this city, I realised this
was not an accident; instead, someone had murdered Mr Marshall.
After the mansion was closed for investigation and everyone had left, I started
looking for clues. The mansion was a big building with many rooms over a huge
land and a lake, and I managed to get a layout of the building (Figure 1) and the
surrounding areas (Figure 2). The main building must have some clues, so I will
search all the rooms.

Problem:
How to search all the rooms in the building without missing any?


Part 2: Cracking the chest lock code.
I was looking in the library; there were stacks of books on the table and hundreds of
books on the shelves around the room. Apparently, Mr Marshall does a lot of
reading and spends much time in this room. I found an old safe on one of the
shelves, and after close inspection, it requires a 3-digit number combination to
open it (Figure 2). I look around for the code, but I guess I must figure out how to
crack this safe.
? ? ?

Problem:
What is the possible number combination for the lock?


Part 3: Same but not identical.
I was finally able to open the safe. Inside there are several documents, but at the
very top, two letters look the same, or so I thought, since after a closer look, they
are not identical (Figure 3).

Figure 4: The two letters from the safe.
Problem:
What are the different words from the two letters?
Dear Annabel,
I hope you’re doing fine. Are you excited
about the summer break? Thank you for
your last letter. It’s always lovely to hear
about what’s going on back home.
I’m writing to you to invite you to come to
visit me during the holidays. If the
weather is terrible, we could go to the art
and history museums. We could even
spend the day at the park, or walk around
the state fair. We could go to that café
you like or take a day trip on the boat.
It would be great to spend a few weeks
with you here in the city. We’d have a lot
of fun! I know how much you love the city.
Let me know your thoughts. If you decide
to come, we can start making plans for
what we’ll do while you’re here.
I hope to hear from you soon, and I hope
to see you soon.
With best wishes,
Phillip

Dear Annabel,
I hope you’re doing great. Are you excited
about the winter break? Thank you for
your last letter. It’s always lovely to hear

visit me during the holidays. If the
weather is terrible, we could go to the art
and history museums. We could even
spend the day at the park, or walk around
the state fair. We could go to that café
you like or take a night trip on the boat.
It would be great to spend a few weeks
with you here in the city. We’d have a lot
of fun time! I know how much you love the
city.
Let me know your thoughts. If you decide

I hope to hear from you soon, and I hope

Part 4: Find that book.
The different words found between the two letters sounded like a book title. I look
around the library, there are hundreds of books here, but thankfully they are sorted
alphabetically.
Problem:
How to find the book quickly?


Part 5: Secret message.
I finally found the book. Between the pages, I found a piece of paper containing,
what looks like, a secret message (Figure 4).

Problem:
How to decode the secret message?

Part 6: Find the next clue.
I went to the shed. True enough, there is a trolley and several other items. The
trolley can carry at most 30kg of items. And the items in the shed are as follows
(Table 1):
Item Weight
A sack of corn for the chicken at the barn. 12kg
A hoe for the green house. 5kg
An oil tank filled with fuel for the boat at lake. 10kg
Four pieces of tyres for the car in the garage. 16kg
Table 1: Items in the garden shed and their weight.
I thought Mr Marshall must have visited the area based on his trolley capacity to
carry these items. The next clue must be there.
Problem:
Find out which item was carried on the trolley.


Part 7: Almost there!
Based on the items carried, I visited all the areas. I found another secret message
(Figure 5) in a bottle in one of the areas!
Figure 6: The secret message.
Although it didn’t make sense initially, I realised each line was a word with jumbled
letters.
Problem:
What is the secret message?

Part 8: Murder suspect.
So, from the last message, I know the murderer must have a strong motive. Is it
money? Or something else?
I list each family member's characteristics, relationship with Mr Marshall, and net
worth below (Table 2).
Name Relationship Character Net worth ($)
Jones Marshall Son Always rude to
people especially
his father.
1Mil
Jenna Marshall Daughter The quiet one in
the family.
700K
Peter Marshall Brother Animal lover. 50K
Penelope Marshall Sister Playful despite of
her old age.
500K
Will Marshall Uncle Retired army
officer
10K
Table 2: Mr Marshall’s family members, characteristics, and wealth.
The murderer must be one of them. But who?
Problem:
Who has the most significant motive to be the suspect in this murder?


Part 9:
Decide how the story ends. Have fun with it!
